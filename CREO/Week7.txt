Name three (3) constraints you used to assemble the parts of the Can Crusher?

	1) Default
	2) Coincide
	3) Parallel

What does it mean when the part you are assembling is magenta in colour?

	Not fully constrained

How does modelling at the assembly level differ to modelling a part and why is it useful?

	Functions similarly to modelling a part but changes affect the entire assembly. Came in very handy
	when I realised I had the wrong measurements for a hole and changed it on the fly. The assembly then
	conformed to the new position of the hole.

What is an issue that can occur when modelling at the assembly level?

	You can link a models properties (i.e. the position of a hole) to another object in the model, which can cause issues.
